This is a Processing (http://www.processing.org) program in Java that causes a video to appear glitchy, sort as if packets/frames are being dropped, but not exactly. It's not intended for anything particularly serious, but just a cool effect for artists. 

Example output:

A window of controls allows you to tweak the effect as the video plays. 

Tested under Processing 2.0.3 and Java 1.6. In order to use Processing in Eclipse, I recommend you install Proclipsing: https://code.google.com/p/proclipsing/
